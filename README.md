# Simple Finite Element Solver

- Implement finite element method for 2D structural example [in the pin truss Notebook](pin_truss.ipynb)
- Element stiffness matrix initially derived with direct method
- Reading from: David Hutton, Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis

## To Do

- Resolve stability issues complex truss
- Procedure for meshing a model
- Plot stress heatmap
- **Generalise element stiffness matrix derivation (method of weighted residuals)**
