# Simple Finite Element Solver

- Implement finite element method for 2D structural example [in the pin truss Notebook](pin_truss.ipynb)
- Element stiffness matrix initially derived with direct method
- Reading from: David Hutton, Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis

## To Do

Programming
- Apply to more complex truss
- Procedure for meshing a model
- Back substiture for element tensions and plot tension heatmap

Theory
- Generalise element stiffness matrix derivation (method of weighted residuals)
